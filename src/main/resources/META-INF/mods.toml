This mod was made by 989onan#0794. This is my first mod, so it is garbage. 
I made this as my many other garbage mods to satisfy my needs of making random crap involving cars.
Enjoy?
Also contact me on discord if you want the source code to try to make your own mod. It's also on the original mod page! :P
